The Web-GUI tools provide a web-based interface for interacting with TIPL, currently it is just setup for monitoring purposes and basic visualizations (preview slices, histogram statistics, etc). The plans are to implement fully the DeepZoom support so images can be browsed in this manner as well as adding the ability to construct basic analyses using Blocks and Plugins. 
Finally the ability to perform simple statistical analysis should be integrated into this tool as well
